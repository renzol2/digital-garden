# Cutoff frequency

In [[filter-response-curve|FIR]] [[high-pass-filter|high pass]]/[[low-pass-filter|low pass]] [[filter|filters]], the **cutoff frequency** marks the [[frequency]] point where the [[audio-signal|signal]] energy is reduced by 3 [[decibel|dB]], called the half-power point

- divides the output [[spectrum]] into _pass band_ and _stop band_

Filters that slightly boost at the cutoff frequency are [[infinite-impulse-response|IIR]] filters where the [[feedback]] boosts frequencies at the cutoff before going through with the attenuation
