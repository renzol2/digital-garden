# Beating

**Beating** is a phenomenon that occurs when periodic waves are combined, resulting in [[amplitude]] fluctuations.

When summed, two periodic waves with slightly different frequencies exhibit a periodic change in [[phase]] relationship, resulting in amplitude fluctuations.

- in [[sound-waves|sound waves]], when the difference in [[frequency]] between two waves exceeds 20 Hz, it transitions to become two audible tones
