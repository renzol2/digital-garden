# Frequency Modulation

In **frequency modulation** (FM), the frequency of a _carrier_ signal is altered by a _modulator_ signal.

Deviations of the carrier causes spectral sidebands at multiples of the modulator above and below the carrier.

## The C:M Ratio

The **carrier to modulator ratio (C:M)** determines the harmonicity of the resulting spectrum

- for harmonic spectra, $M$ must have an integer relationship to $C$
- Non integer ratios produce inharmonic spectra

## Composing with FM

In [[spectral-composition|spectral composition]], FM is a powerful algorithm for generating spectral note sets!

- can generate inharmonic (dissonant) or [[harmonic-series|harmonic]] (consonant) sets
