# Feedback comb filter

The **feedback comb filter** uses feedback in its design as opposed to a feedforward signal like its counterpart.

The feedback comb filter is an example of an [[infinite-impulse-response|IIR]] digital [[filter]]. It can be regarded as a computational physical model of a _series_ of echoes.
