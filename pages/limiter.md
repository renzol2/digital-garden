# Limiter

A **limiter** is a [[docs/compression|compressor]] with an extremely high ratio, typically 10:1 or greater.

Limiters are used when preventing clipping/overloading has top priority, e.g.:

- operating in a volatile digital system, such as live coding or a no-input mixer performance
- recording in a live concert setting to prevent overloading the absolute dynamic range of any component in the recording chain
- to prevent damage to irreplaceable equipment
- when there is only one opportunity to capture a unique recording
- more commonly, to prevent clipping during the analog-to-digital conversion process

Limiters use peak/[[transient]] tracking and/or a "look ahead" delay to properly anticipate and limit instantaneous peak levels.
