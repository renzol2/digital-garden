# Bandwidth Enhanced Oscillator

A **bandwidth enhanced oscillator (BEO)** is a [[sine-wave|sine wave]] [[oscillator]] that has been modified to allow the introduction of variable [[noise]] bandwidth.

BEOs are used in [[spectral-modeling-synthesis|spectral modeling synthesis]] after [[mcaulay-quatieri-algorithm|MQ]] analysis to generate both [[harmonic-series|harmonic]] and [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] components.

In SMS with BEOs, each BEO generates a [[partial]] with four parameters:

- [[amplitude]] [[envelope]]
- [[frequency]] envelope
- bandwidth envelope
- starting [[phase]] (usually computed to result in a desired phase value at end of [[transient]])

The use of BEOs has several benefits in SMS:

- high fidelity [[sound-synthesis]] for breathy and [[transient]] sounds; more accurate than standalone noise generators
- **homogeneity** of model promises greater control over voice quality modifications
- easier to manipulate sinusoidal and noise components together
- less expensive than using additional oscillators

## Bandwidth Envelope

The bandwidth envelope $\beta(n)$ controls "noisiness" (how much energy from the partial is spread to nearby frequencies) by multiplying the amplitude envelope of a partial by a variable amount of narrowband noise.
