# Noise Representation

In DSP, **noise representation** refers to the methods in which [[noise]] in a [[audio-signal|signal]] is both [[spectral-analysis|analyzed]] and [[sound-synthesis|synthesized]].

Within [[mcaulay-quatieri-algorithm|McAulay-Quatieri]] analysis, noise is modeled by short & jittery [[partial]]s.

- can be generated through many [[sine-generator|sine generators]]
  - usually causes low [[amplitude]] artifacts, solved partly through [[hysteresis]] parameters
- can be generated by [[bandwidth-enhanced-oscillator|bandwidth enhanced oscillators]]
  - reduces amount of oscillators required, reduces artifacts
- these methods more common in [[long-window-time-varying-spectral-analysis|long window analysis]] (according to Haken)
