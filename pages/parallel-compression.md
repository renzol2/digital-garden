# Parallel Compression

Parallel compression is a [[docs/compression|compression]] technique that involves blending an original dry signal with a compressed duplicate of the original signal (wet)

- offers a "best of both worlds" between the [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] of an uncompressed track and the control of a compressed track by applying compression "in parallel".

## Steps

- Begin with a dry, uncompressed track
- Duplicate that track
- Generally, apply heavy compression that stuffs out the [[transient|transients]] (should not sound natural on its own)
- Blend the dry and wet (compressed) tracks together
