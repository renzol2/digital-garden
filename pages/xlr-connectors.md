# XLR Connectors

**XLR connectors** are a family of [[connectors-audio|audio connectors]] comprised of 3-conductor cable, [[balanced-audio]], [[professional-grade-audio]] cables.

- opposite connectors (male/female) on either end of most cables, often with locking mechanism
- by convention, [[audio-signal]] flows from male to female connector
- can be "daisy-chained" (unlike [[telephone-connectors|TS/TRS cables]], which are male at both ends).

XLR connectors are comprised of 3 parts:

1. sleeve (ground/shield)
2. tip (+/hot/non-inverted)
3. ring (-/cold/inverted)
