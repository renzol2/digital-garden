# Expander

Like a compressor ([[compression]]), an **expander** is an amplifier whose gain is determined by an input signal level.

- has a threshold and ratio, but expands the [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] instead of compressing it
- when signal < threshold, expansion effect becomes active and attenuates the signal

Expanders are typically used to make quiet sounds even quieter. They

- e.g. reducing noise in old analog recordings
- noise gates and expanders often used for similar purposes

Like compressors, ratio expressed as input change to output change

- below threshold, a ratio of 1:3 means if the input falls by 1 [[decibel|dB]], the output will fall by 3 [[decibel|dB]]
