## History of Computer Music

See: [[MUSIC-N]]

### Early Computer Music at Illinois

1957, Illinois faculty **Lejaren Hiller** & **Leonard Isaacson**

- both chemists/composers
- created the _Illiac Suite_, a four-movement string quartet
- first musical score to be generated by a computer using the ILLIAC I (Illinois Automatic Computer), built/acquired in 1952
- first computer at the U of I; 2.8k vacuum tubes, 10ft tall, 5 ton weight
- components currently on display in Siebel Center lobby

Two important academic centers founded ca. 1957-1958:

**University of Illinois Experimental Studios**:

- founded by Lejaren Hiller
- initially focused on computer music composition, later expanding into analog tape-based composition and other areas

**Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center**:

- founded by Otto Luening & Vladimir Ussachevsky (Columbia), Milton Babbit & Roger Sessions (Princeton)
- initially focused on analog tape-based composition, later expanding into computer music and other areas
- notable collaboration with Bell Labs

Two more computer music centers established in the 1970s:

**IRCAM**: Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique

- est. Paris, 1970, by Pierre Boulez

**CCRMA**: Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics

- est. Stanford University, CA, 1976, by John Chowning and Leland Smith

Both are still active hubs for electroacoustic/computer music today.

In the early decades of computer music, computer music was being created at institutional centers rather than in homes since mainframe computers were very expensive and required a high level of specialized knowledge.

## Digital Audio Concepts

### Digital Audio Key Terms

**sampling**: the process of periodically measuring the amplitude of an analog signal and assigning a digital value to each measurement (see [[sampling]])

**sample rate**: number of samples taken per second

**quantization**: the process of approximating the measured analog value to the closest digital value

**bit depth**: the number of discrete digital values available for quantization (also called sample resolution or sample width)

**ADC**: analog-to-digital converter

**DAC**: digital-to-analog converter

**sampling theorem**: publication on the mathematical limitations of discretization of continuous signals

- Harry Nyquist, 1928
- also called Nyquist Theorem or Shannon-Nyquist Theorem

**pulse code modulation (PCM)**: specification for computer digitization of continuous signals

- patented by Alec Reeves, 1938
- became one of the primary standardizations for digital representation of analog signals

### Sampling (disambiguation)

Sampling can have different meanings, depending on context.

- Using a significant portion of an existing work as a component in a new work
- Recording individual sound units from a musical instrument or other sound source, typically mapped to physical controls on a MIDI device and played back (see: [[midi]])
- **taking periodic measurements of an analog signal**
