# Serial Compression

**Serial compression** is a [[compression]] technique where multiple compressors are used in a row in series, rather than just one compression.

- results in a more natural sound when applying light compression with multiple compressors vs. heavy compression with one compressor
- applies to [[limiter|limiting]] as well, especially during mastering
