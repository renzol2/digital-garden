# Tape

**Tape** is a [[magnetic-recording|magnetic recording]] technology that saw widespread availability and development post-WWII, ca. 1948.

- development by Ampex, Rangertone, 3M

Over time, tape saw gradual improvements in tape speed, duration, and [[frequency-response|frequency response]]

- 1847: 3M develops a red oxide-coated plastic tape, 7.5 inches/sec, frequency response up to 150 kHz

Tape decks became smaller, more portable, oriented toward consumer high-fidelity/home entertainment

- aided by improved user interfaces, transistors replacing [[vacuum-tube|vacuum tubes]]

Technics RS-1500 reel-to-reel tape recorder (ca. 1976-1985)
