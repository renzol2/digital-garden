# Telephone connectors

Telephone plugs & jacks are often used in conjunction with [[audio-hardware]] to facilitate connections.

- Not really used for telephones anymore, but historically were used for telephones
- family of [[connectors-audio|audio connectors]] descending from telephone switchboards from the 19th century

## Common plug sizes

- quarter inch (1/4")
- tiny telephone (TT)
- eighth inch (1/8") or 3.5 mm
  - used for [[consumer-grade-audio]] equipment, not very durable

## 2-conductor

- tip-sleeve (TS)
- [[unbalanced-audio|unbalanced]], [[consumer-grade-audio|consumer-grade]] equipment
  - sleeve (ground/shield)
  - tip (+/hot/non-inverted)
- only one use - transmit [[audio-signal|signal]]

## 3-conductor

- tip-ring-sleeve (TRS)
- [[balanced-audio|balanced]], [[professional-grade-audio|professional grade]] equipment
  - ring (-/cold/inverted)
- has multiple uses
  - signal transmission rejection of interference (balanced audio, typical usage)
  - inserting a signal into a signal flow (send on tip, return on ring)
  - TRS â†’ split into Y cable of two TS cables
  - transmission of stereo signal, e.g. headphones (left on tip, right on ring)
