# Granular Synthesis

Granular synthesis is a method of synthesizing sound, like spray-painting; atomizing small portions or windows of a sound and rearranging them in new ways.

It is a technique used in [[music-composition]] and production.

Granular synthesis can be used both functionally and compositionally. Functionally, it can be used for time-stretching audio without changing [[docs/frequency|frequency]]. Compositionally, using granular synthesis on sounds with significant [[transient|transients]] (rather than sustained sounds) can create interesting gestures at the note level.
