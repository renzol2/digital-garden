# Granular Synthesis

Granular synthesis is a method of [[sound-synthesis|synthesizing sound]] that manipulates [[sound-waves|sound]] on the [[microsound]] level.

- like spray-painting; atomizing small portions or windows of a sound and rearranging them in new ways.

It is a technique used in [[music-composition]] and production.

- invention of granular synthesis commonly attributed to **Iannis Xenakis** [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_synthesis#History)

Granular synthesis can be used both functionally and compositionally. Functionally, it can be used for time-stretching audio without changing [[frequency|frequency]]. Compositionally, using granular synthesis on sounds with significant [[transient|transients]] (rather than sustained sounds) can create interesting gestures at the note level.
