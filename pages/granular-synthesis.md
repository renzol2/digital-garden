# Granular Synthesis

Granular synthesis is like spray-painting; atomizing small portions or windows of a sound and rearranging them in new ways.

Granular synthesis can be used both functionally and compositionally. Functionally, it can be used for time-stretching audio without changing [[pages/frequency]]. Compositionally, using granular synthesis on sounds with significant transients (rather than sustained sounds) can create interesting gestures at the note level.
