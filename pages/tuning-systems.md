# Tuning Systems

Much of the history of (Western) music was figuring out tuning systems that would facilitate key modulation.

- [[just-tuning|just tuning]] is based on the naturally occurring [[harmonic-series]].

- [[TET|twelve equal temperament]] tuning was developed as a practical system for facilitating modulation. It is the most common system of tuning today.

Many cultures do not have standard tunings.

- the [[kulintang]] does not have a strict tuning system
