# Fundamental

The **fundamental** is the lowest [[partial]] in a [[spectrum]]. In the context of musical instruments, the fundamental is often what we hear as the perceived [[pitch]].

- in a [[harmonic-series|harmonic]] [[spectrum]], each partial above the fundamental is an integer multiple of the fundamental's [[frequency]]
