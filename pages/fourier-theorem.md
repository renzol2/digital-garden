# Fourier Theorem

The **Fourier theorem** states that any periodic [[waveform]] can be expressed as a sum of sinusoidal vibrations ([[sine-wave|sine waves]]).

Every period wave consists of:

- a [[fundamental]] [[frequency]]
  - the fundamental is the lowest frequency that is present in a complex vibration
  - if the fundamental is the _only_ frequency present in the waveform, we are dealing with a [[sine-wave|sine wave]]
- some number of [[overtone|overtones]]

All these sine waves are collectively called [[partial]]s

- A fundamental is a partial
- An overtone is a partial
- A fundamental is _not_ an overtone

The Fourier theorem also has an [[fourier-inversion-theorem|inverse theorem]], which is often used within applications of both theorems for modifying wave and signal data.

## In Sound

The Fourier Theorem can be applied to [[sound-waves|sound waves]] to pick out specific frequencies present in a [[spectrum]].

> Any **sound** comprised of a periodic waveform can be expressed as a sum of [[sine-wave|sine waves]]
