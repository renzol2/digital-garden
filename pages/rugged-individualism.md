# Rugged individualism

**Rugged individualism** (derived from [[individualism]]) is an ideal where someone is self-reliant and independent from the outside

- usually from state or government assistance
- also from people: friends, family, community

Within [[decolonization]], rugged individualism is a mindset implanted within a [[colonization|colonist]]/capitalist mindset for exploitation of the individual.
