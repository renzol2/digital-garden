# Envelope Shaper

An **envelope shaper** (also **enveloper** or **transient shaper**) modifies an [[audio-signal|signal]]'s [[amplitude]] by applying an [[envelope]].

- a [[threshold-drp|threshold]] is used to detect [[transient|transients]] and determine when to apply an envelope
- according to Fieldsteel, basically a [[compression|compressor]]

Creative applications are largely focused on transient customization.

- enhancing or altering a sound's natural envelope shape
- can create interesting effects by removing or modifying important [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] cues
- related to early [[musique-concrete|music concrète]] research by [[pierre-schaeffer|Pierre Schaeffer]]

DAW volume automation is a form of envelope shaping, but in a [[dynamic-range-processing|DRP]] context, transient modification is assumed to be the area of interest.
