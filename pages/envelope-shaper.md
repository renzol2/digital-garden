# Envelope Shaper

An **envelope shaper** (also **enveloper** or **transient shaper**) modifies a signal's [[amplitude]] by applying an [[envelope]].

- a threshold is used to detect [[transient|transients]] and determine when to apply an envelope

Creative applications are largely focused on transient customization.

- enhancing or altering a sound's natural envelope shape
- can create interesting effects by removing or modifying important psychoacoustic cues
- related to early music concrète research by Pierre Schaeffer

DAW volume automation is a form of envelope shaping, but in a DRP ([[dynamic-range-processing]]) context, transient modification is assumed to be the area of interest.
