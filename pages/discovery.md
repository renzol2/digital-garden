# Discovery

**Discovery** is a foundational method for designing [[user-interface|user interface]] solutions that involves:

- finding the right problem and asking questions
- finding answers to the questions to create design innovation

Almost every design problem has a different target audience, leading to different discovery processes and thus different findings.
