# Certificates (complexity)

**Certificates** are proofs that a given instance is "good". In [[decision-problems]], a certificate is a particular input that solves the problem.

- A certificate for `CircuitSAT` ([[circuit-satisfiability]]) is a set of inputs that turns on the light bulb
- A certificate for `SAT` or `3SAT` is a satisfying assignment
- A certificate for `MaxIndSet` is a large independent set
