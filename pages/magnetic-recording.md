# Magnetic Recording

**Magnetic recording** is a group of [[recording]] technologies that operate through a magnetic medium.

- fundamentally different from [[mechanical-recording|mechanical]] and [[electro-mechanical-recording|electro-mechanical]] recording processes

Magnetic recording operates under the following principle:

- magnetic medium passes across an electromagnet (contained within "record head") at a constant speed
- [[alternating-current|AC]] [[audio-signal|audio signal]] creates a pattern of magnetization on medium
- magnetization medium passes across another electromagnet ("play head") at a constant speed, inducing AC in wire conductor
  - think [[dynamic-microphones|dynamic microphones]] or [[loudspeakers|speakers]]

Due to the magnetic medium, the degradation process occurs over a much longer time.

Prominent magnetic recording devices and technologies include:

- [[Telegraphone]]
- [[Blattnerphone]]
- [[Magnetophon]]
- [[Tape]]
- [[compact-cassette-tape|Compact Cassette Tape]]
- [[multi-track-magnetic-recording|Multi-track magnetic recording]]
