# Dynamic Range

**Dynamic Range**: Difference between highest/lowest level ([[decibel|dB]]) of an audio signal

- difference between _loudest_ and _quietest_ part of a signal
- a big part of orchestral music is _large dynamic range_: the drama between the quietest parts of the piece and the loudest parts
- meanwhile, pop music generally has a small dynamic range to be loud across the whole song: for uniformity of energy, to be heard over background noise, etc.
