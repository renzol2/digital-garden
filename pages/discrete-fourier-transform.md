# Discrete Fourier Transform

A **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** converts a sequence of equally-spaced discrete samples into a complex-valued function of frequency.

- the resulting complex-valued function is called the **Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)**

## Application

DFTs are almost always implemented using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms, and are utilized in digital signal and image processing applications.
