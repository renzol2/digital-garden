# Short-time Fourier Transform

The **Short-time Fourier transform (STFT)** is a [[fourier-transform|Fourier transform]] used to determine the [[sine-wave|sinusoidal]] [[frequency|frequencies]] and [[phase]] content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time.

- procedure for computing STFTs is to divide a longer signal into shorter segments and individually compute Fourier transforms on each segment
- each Fourier transform is then plotted onto a spectrogram or other visualization
