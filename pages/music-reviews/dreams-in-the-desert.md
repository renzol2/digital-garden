# Elainie Lillios - Dreams in the Desert (2001)

[Elainie Lillios](http://elillios.com/about)

Elaine Lillios' _Dreams in the Desert_ feels like a sequence of different dream-like sections, taking individual elements of real-world [[sound-waves|sounds]], manipulating them, and combining them to create a dream-like texture reminiscent of, but not completely analogous to, real-life.

From my listening interpretation, Lillios presents three main sound objects or "motifs"; water, sand, and some other "crunchier" sound that feels like someone stepping on leaves or rocks. The water sounds, heard from the beginning of the piece until about the 3:11 mark, are panned in ways that creating a ping-pong like effect between the left and right channels. Additionally, Lillios seems to exaggerate certain [[frequency|frequencies]] in the samples to create "chords" from the resonances, implying traditional harmony amongst the moving textures of the water.

The second main sound object, the "sand", or rather more of a [[noise]]-like sweep, is first heard at 3:11 and again at 5:20 and 9:09. While I don't actually know if this is sand, I like to interpret these sounds as "sand-like" to match the piece's title, _Dreams in the Desert_. The mental imagery I have is that of an oasis inside a mirage, coming in and out of existence. While this sand-like noise isn't as prominent as the water, Lillios seems to use it to transition between different sections of the piece.

The third main sound object is the "crunchy" sound first appearing at the 3:50 mark. Lillios gave this sound a prominent section that greatly contrasts from the other parts of the piece. Notably, at the 4:50 mark, the crunches are accompanied by large amounts of reverb or some other spatially-enhancing effect that eventually builds into the climax at 6:40, where all three sound objects come together to create a very pleasing soundmass that incorporates all previously introduced elements.

While there are other elements of interest, I find this motivic development an interesting part of Lillios' piece, and I am curious mostly as to how the water sounds are manipulated to create the chord-like texture.
