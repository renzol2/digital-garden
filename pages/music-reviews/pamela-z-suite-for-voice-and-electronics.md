# Pamela Z - Suite for Voice and Electronics

I found these pieces to be an amazing exploration of the voice and the possible manipulations you can perform with just the voice. Pamela Z utilized the voice in some way for every performance, and each performance had a slightly different usage.

_Quatre Couches_ used a combination of many performance aspects Pamela Z uses across all these performances. It seems that she's recording her own voice, storing them as [[sampling-composition|samples]], and affecting those samples with various effects, including [[digital-delay-line|delay]], [[reverb]], and looping. To trigger the samples, she uses the electronic device in front of her to detect her hand motions, possibly through light or some other method. Either way, this device allows a minute level of control that she exhibits through her finger motions to create organic changes in the samples. Through these methods, I felt as if Pamela Z presented and developed a motif at the beginning of the piece, then manipulated and developed that motif electronically, which I really enjoyed. It's almost as if every performance of _Quatre Couches_ will have a slightly different motif since it's recorded each performance, and that motif will be manipulated further through the electronics to create entirely unique experiences each performance.

_Badagada_ uses a more rhythmic, looping ostinato sampled at the beginning of the piece, which differs from the more time-fluid form of the previous performance. Unlike _Quatre Couches_, it seems that _Badagada_ relies less heavily on pre-recorded samples and the manipulation of samples using the electronic device, and moreso features Pamela Z's live performance and the samples she records during the performance itself.

_Typewriter_ uses the electronic device to simulate a physical object through [[sound-waves|sound]] and gesture alone, which was both amusing and interesting. \*\*This piece really highlights the versatility and creative freedom of the sensor that Pamela Z uses.

_Breathing_ seemed to focus a lot more on the manipulation of recorded samples through more electronic devices, like gloves with gyroscope sensors to sense the angle of Pamela Z's voice to control [[filter|filtering]] and looping parameters. Like _Badagada_, _Breathing_ highlights live recorded samples primarily.

Overall, I really enjoyed Pamela Z's use of live performance through her voice and the manipulation of live recorded samples with electronics. Having a sensor to sense delicate hand movements seems to offer an amazing level of control, similar to a theremin. I think this method of performance can definitely be explored more, and it pushed my boundaries of what I thought live performance with [[electroacoustic-music|electroacoustic music]] could be.
