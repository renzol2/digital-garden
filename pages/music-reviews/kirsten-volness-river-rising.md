# Kirsten Volness - River Rising

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgyTUIHaBJc)

Overall, I enjoyed this piece for its evolving atmosphere and combination of violin with stereo [[digital-audio|audio]] and live electronics. Based on the piece description as well as the overall tone and mood of the piece, I felt a sense of fluctuating emotional toil, as if someone is trying to process and navigate their way through indescribable grief or pain.

The atmosphere throughout the piece comprises of lower [[frequency]], drone-like parts alongside more fluid, almost periodic higher frequency parts, which I felt left room for the violin to be heard and highlighted. The first two minutes mostly feature the higher frequency parts with the violin playing alongside, and I interpret the focus of violin as a way to place the violin as the "main character" of this piece, either as a character to be watched or as a way for the listener to insert themselves into the piece.

After the first 2 minutes, the lower frequencies begin to slowly fill the soundscape as the intensity of the parts grows to a climax at around the 3:30 mark, indicated by a more frantic violin part. The dissonance created by the atmospheric parts felt dark and toilsome to me, as if this moment were a turning point in the main character's process of grief.

Near the 5:10 mark, a low noise begins to engulf the soundscape, creating a sense of impending doom or lingering, permeating weight. At around 6:20-6:40, the noise slowly fades out to bring the violin back to the forefront, giving a sense of closure and space to breathe. By this point, the structure of the piece has shown a progression of low to high intensity moments, complemented by density of stereo audio/live electronic parts and the franticness of the violin part.

To create such a spacious, dense atmosphere, I believe Volness may have used generous amounts of [[reverb]] and [[digital-delay-line|delay]] to alter an original [[sound-waves|sound]] source, one that was either recorded or generated synthetically. The higher frequency parts seem to blend between recorded, ambient noises from nature or out in the world, and synthesized instruments with heavy effects. It was difficult for me to pinpoint how or where the lower frequency drones could have been created, though I imagine the process was similar to the higher frequency parts. A combination of layering of parts and automation of effects may have been used to create the swelling atmosphere. Overall, I really enjoyed _River Rising_ and would be open to studying it further.
