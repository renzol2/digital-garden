# Jon Christopher Nelson - Turbulent Blue (2009)

Out of all the listening examples we've had for this class, _Turbulent Blue_ by Jon Christopher Nelson utilized the stereo field most prominently and to great effect for a very unique listening experience - I was glad to have been in one of the studios to do this assignment, as I felt that listening to this piece there really highlighted the work that Nelson put into the panning for _Turbulent Blue_.

Notably, Nelson focuses much of the panning work on high [[frequency]] noises, oftentimes with sharp [[transient]]s, to accentuate the effect of the stereo field. While many of the sounds heard are non-[[pitch]]ed and filled with noise, the high frequencies present in these sounds draw attention to whichever side of the stereo field they are placed in, and Nelson uses this effect generously to either build intensity or create interest out of even a single sound.

For example, at 2:15, the rich, distorted sound that permeates for around 30 seconds is continually being moved left and right across the stereo field, giving a sense of movement and change in a sound that already has a fluid, morphing texture.

In contrast, sections like 4:00 introduce a vast array of different sounds and [[timbre]]s that waltz across the stereo field. These sounds are largely percussive in nature, or at the very least have sharp attacks. As mentioned, they also have significant high frequency content to cue the listener into their position more easily.

Compared to the other pieces we've listened to, I noticed that this piece has less of a focus on more conventional instruments or performance components, which I think is interesting. Personally, I would like to study this piece more closely, focusing on the [[music-composition|composition]] process and methodology behind the stereo work that Nelson achieved.
