Considering that the previous piece by Kyong Mee Choi was also written for piano and electronics, I listened to _Piano Piece for piano and electronic sound_ by Olly Wilson with the intention of comparing and contrasting the [[music-composition|compositional]] decisions made by these two composers. Compared to Kyong Mee Choi's _Dawn and Dusk_, Wilson's electronics sound more distorted and industrial than those in _Dawn and Dusk_.

Rather than creating an atmosphere using [[reverb]] to accentuate the piano parts, Wilson uses electronics almost like another instrument playing in conversation with the piano by using distortion and [[digital-delay-line|delay]] on the samples. Some notable examples of distortion include high-[[pitch]]ed distorted tones at 3:42, mid-range delayed samples near 3:59, and distorted, reverberant parts near 7:57. The piano often imitated these distorted tones with dissonant chords and angular lines, taking full advantage of the piano's spectral range in a way that Choi does in _Dawn and Dusk_. While I'm not confident in my listening, it does seem like Wilson uses other aspects of the piano other than just the keyboard, such as touching the strings of the piano or using its body as a percussive surface.

Similar to Choi, Wilson also employs a dynamic, developing form for his piece that grows in intensity through dissonance, distortion, and frequency of notes. However, while the medium is the same for both pieces, Wilson invokes a different dynamic between the piano and electronics by having their parts interact more closely together, either playing together or almost playing in call-and-response form. With this piece being written in 1969, I wonder how Wilson was able to [[sound-synthesis|synthesize]] the electronic sounds he did, and what his thought process was behind composing the piano parts alongside the electronic media.
