To me, the most intriguing part of this piece was the use of the piano not necessarily to play precise notes of a particular scale-like structure, but moreso Kyong Mee Choi's decision to take advantage of the dynamic and "spectral" range of the piano. It felt more like she composed for the piano like one would a [[synthesizer]] or electronic instrument, focusing more on the range and [[amplitude]] of sounds you could play on the piano rather than the notes themselves.

The sounds from the piano tended to range between short, percussive hits on the high register on the piano during the more ethereal, ambient portions of the piece (the 0:00, 6:00, and 11:30 minute mark), and more drone-like rolling of hands on the keys and strings of the piano in more intense, thicker parts of the piece (3:25, 10:15 minute marks). This dichotomy of [[timbre]]s is often bridged by transitional moments of arpeggios and electronic textures mixing with those of the piano, creating a sweep and swell that highlights a moving structure throughout the piece.

The electronics included with the piece do really well to accentuate the piano performance, creating noise and sparse tones to create a more [[reverb]]erant sound throughout the entire piece and fill lots of space - I imagined a large, open field as a visual "setting" for a piece like this. Many of the sounds from the electronics felt like the sounds of real objects manipulated to great effect - while the sounds themselves sounded industrial and hollow-like, the movement of these sounds felt more organic.

I really enjoyed the use of the double pianos and how immense yet serene they can sound when combined with the electronics. I would like to study this piece more to find more closely-linked motifs or themes, as well as learn more about the compositional, creative, and technical processes that went into creating this piece.
