# Ryoji Ikeda - Data.Matrix (2005)

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYSqr-Zkn6A)

Compared to previous listening excerpts, _Data.Matrix_ by Ryoji Ikeda employs rhythm, panning, and specific sound selection to create an immersive, almost groovy listening experience.

The selection of sounds range between low [[sine-wave|sine]]-like bursts, quick [[transient]] clicks that are panned across the stereo field, and [[noise]]-like sounds at various [[frequency]] ranges. The low sine-like bursts serve like the bass of the ensemble, while the quick transient clicks give the piece energy and movement both rhythmically and spatially. The noise-like sounds feel like the main "melody", as the frequency bands are moved across the noise to give the illusion of different notes.

At around 4:30, a more atmospheric noise pops in which seems to be playing some [[sampling-composition|sampled]] instrument or instruments, which contrasts the drier noises that were introduced since the beginning.

One thing I am curious about is the creation of these noises - are these sounds mostly [[sound-synthesis|synthesized]] and arranged accordingly, or are these recorded samples that have been [[filter|filtered]] or altered? I could see both methods being the case, but the sounds themselves are so clean and almost pure sounding that if I were to do this myself, I may resort to using mostly synthesis. Regardless, I would love to analyze this piece further in both a musical and technical sense.
