# Brian Eno - Tal Coat (1982)

## Initial Notes

- water-like sounds, bubbly, underwater
- tonal, use of drone (saw-like), focusing on C
- sequenced [[sound-synthesis|synth]] sounds, noisy/[[filter|filtered]], almost [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]]
- piano
- string/string-pad
- overhead noise or dense inharmonic [[spectrum]]
- Bb, F# over C
- gently wavering [[amplitude]], especially in the bass

## Writeup

The drone-like atmosphere of this Brian Eno's _Tal Coat_ felt like a meditation. Over my first listen, I paid attention to two main things: the individual components of the atmosphere and the harmony evoked throughout the piece, both of which serve to reinforce the meditative atmosphere laid out by Brian Eno.

The atmosphere itself is made of several components, and Eno blends these components in and out of the foreground to create an ever-evolving atmosphere that gently wavers. The atmospheric components are comprised of the following:

A saw-like synth bass drone permeates the piece, staying primarily on C while occasionally switching tones before going back to C.

Synth pads continually float throughout the piece, and they tend to sound like anything from strings to voices, with an ever-changing [[timbre]] to keep the atmosphere from being stagnant.

A bubbly mix of sequenced pluck-like synth hits begin within the first few seconds of the piece and continue until the end in the higher register. I also heard a brief instance of piano at 2:20.

These tonal components are overlaid by a wash of high-register noise and a blend of deep, bubble-like samples to give an underwater vibe to the entire piece. Additionally, the pads and bass move across the C mixolydian scale (with the pads playing an E -> F# -> G at 4:18 for a Lydian flavor) although they mostly avoid the third. This tendency of [[pitch|pitches]] creates an ambiguity in tonality (neither major or minor), which I think serves to leave the listener in both a harmonic "limbo" of sorts; very complementary of the floaty, bubbly atmosphere.

While I felt no strong sense of traditional form in this piece, the ever-changing timbre and small little moments of one-time sounds made the piece very interesting upon close listening. While it can certainly sit in the background, I felt rewarded noticing the lydian moment in the pads and the sole entrance of the piano. Overall, I enjoyed listening to this piece, and I'm curious as to the overall sculpting of the pads and how exactly each of the components were created.
