# Jonty Harrison - Unsound Objects (1995)

[Jonty Harrison](https://web.archive.org/web/20070707125656/http://artsweb.bham.ac.uk/harrison/biography.htm)

The beginning sounds used throughout Jonty Harrison's _Unsound Objects_ evokes imagery of water and fluidity. They feel both random yet controlled, like concrete patterns that have been iterated over by random processes and [[noise]] to create interesting effects.

The sounds at 4:00 feel percussive in nature, backed by a consistent scratchy water noise. This "scratchiness", which feels almost like sounds of water being time-stretched, is nicely contrasted throughout the piece by natural, unaltered sounds of falling or flowing water.

In conjunction with the water sounds, the sounds at around 5:30 feel almost like someone walking through grass or leaves, which adds a nature-evoking quality to the piece.

At 7:20, the large, growing hiss combined with the pattering of noise reminds me of a shower or fire - like the turning of a faucet into a gush of water that slowly decays into a pattering of shower droplets, or the roar of a fire that eventually settles into a smattering of embers. Like before, the "scratchiness" of these sounds feels like a source sound being time-stretched to be slower than originally captured.

Overall, I enjoyed Harrison's piece for dipping feet both in familiar and unfamiliar territory for the listener; some sounds remained unaltered and clear, with a distinct environmental or objectual association, while others used those source sounds in creative ways to create interesting and unique textures.
