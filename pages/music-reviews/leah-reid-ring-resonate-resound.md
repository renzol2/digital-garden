I enjoyed listening to _Ring, Resonate, Resound_ by Leah Reid particularly because of its focus on bell sounds. Personally, I find bell sounds extremely pleasing, and it's been interesting to learn about the [[spectral-analysis|spectral]] anatomy of bell sounds over the past few classes. We've focused primarily on the [[sound-waves|sound]] of a bell as being an [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] [[spectrum]] of [[sine-wave|sine waves]] where the higher [[partial]]s fade faster than than the lower partials, resulting in the initial "ringing" attack/[[transient]] of a bell that gradually fades into a more resonant, lower ring.

Where _Ring, Resonate, Resound_ seems to deviates from this basic understanding of a bell is in its use of bell [[timbre]]s in other parts of the spectrum, as well as how these timbres interact in different spans of time. The piece begins with a clanging of different bell sounds: a precursor to the climax of the piece. Throughout the first half, the piece focuses more on thin and bright bell noises, both percussive and ambient in nature. One interesting sound I latched onto at 1:27 sounded like high bell noises with sliding [[pitch]]es.

As the piece develops, however, more lower frequency bell-like timbres are introduced, creating a deeper ambience that covers more of the audible spectrum. This ambience is accompanied with percussive bell sounds that we are accustomed to, and it shows Reid's exploration of bell-like timbres across the different frequency bands. The climax serves as a showcase of bell timbres across the entire spectrum at once, culminating in a mix of sparkly bell-like twinkles at the top, a loud drum-like accent at the bottom, and many mid-range crashes of bell timbres in the middle.

Overall, I really enjoyed the progression and form of this piece, as well as its focus on bells, and am curious as to how much of the piece was composed using just the manipulation of [[sampling-composition|samples]], or if there were sounds produced through [[frequency-modulation|FM synthesis]] as alluded to the piece's description as being an homage to John Chowning and his research and discovery of FM synthesis.
