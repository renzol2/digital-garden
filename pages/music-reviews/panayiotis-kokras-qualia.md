# Panayiotis Kokoras - Qualia (2017)

[Panayiotis Kokoras](http://panayiotiskokoras.com/)

Whether this piece was made through real sound objects or [[sound-synthesis|synthesized]], it reminds me of many real-world [[sound-waves|sounds]] and even instruments - birds, horns, sirens, cars, cows, both living and non-living objects with distinct sounds. The first part of the piece feels like an introduction to many of these sounds. However, at around the 2:30 mark, I felt that the collection of sound objects began to a form a more musical, ensemble-like arrangement, with the percussion and low-[[frequency]] noises offering a sort of groove to go along with.

In general, the presence of very low frequency sounds feels very sparse, reserved for few hits in the piece like at ~2:30, 4:43, and 7:40 with the fireworks and crashes. This careful use of low frequencies helps emphasize the moments where Kokoras does indeed use low frequency noises

The playfulness of the first section contrasts with the second section beginning at ~5:05, where Kokoras employs more ambient noises of a different selection - less focus on very distinctive, real-world sounds, and more on the ambience of synthesized sounds (or at least sounds that sound more synthesized).

Overall, I wonder what the goal or role of this piece is in general, and how Kokoras used certain techniques to create the sounds present in _Qualia_.
