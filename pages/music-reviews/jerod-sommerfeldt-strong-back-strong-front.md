# Jerod Sommerfeldt - Strong Back, Soft Front (2016)

Rather than listening to the piece just as a listening assignment, I decided to take part in the meditation as described in the recording of Frank Ostaseski and participate in the breathing and mindfulness he talked about. Overall, I think the sonic additions that Sommerfeldt used in conjunction with Ostaseski's words helped to enhance the meditative experience by simulating an audible sense of breathing in the sounds used.

Focusing on the piece itself, much of the sounds used are very reminiscent of conventional sounds I would associate with meditation. Examples include the slow, methodical talking of Ostaseski, the slow-decaying bell-like ringing (ex. 0:40), the [[noise-gate|gated]] ambience with chant-like textures (2:20), sweeping wide-band [[noise]] (3:25), and even a quiet heartbeat (4:00). These sound objects help solidify the meditative atmosphere.

Throughout the piece, there is definitely some form and variation in how these sounds are expressed - there are often quiet moments that build up to large, expansive climaxes, with Ostaseski's talking in-between. It helps to create a sense of progression throughout the piece, giving it a bit of life and breath that hits on the nose of Ostaseski's words.

In general, as someone who engages a lot with popular genres and styles of music, I think these kinds of pieces help to remind me that music and [[sound-waves|sound]] in general is incredibly experiential, and that sound has the capability of affecting our minds and bodies, leaving long-lasting impressions on us that can affect us in many different ways.

Lately, after focusing a lot on productivity and maximizing my work output throughout my daily life (even my musical life), using a piece like this as a way to have a meaningful, meditative experience was very refreshing. It reminded me particularly that our lives do not have to be solely defined by the productive output (music or otherwise) we can muster, but rather we can find meaning and importance in the individual experiences and feelings we have at any given moment.
