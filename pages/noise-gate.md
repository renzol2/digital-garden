# Noise Gate

A **noise gate** (or simply **gate**) is a switch that opens/closes depending on whether signal level is above/below threshold

- when signal > threshold, the gate is "open" and allows signal to pass through
- when signal level <= threshold, the gate is "closed" silencing the signal

Gates are commonly used for removing low-level background noise.

- assumed that noise level is below signal level
- for basic gates, not possible to remove noise while signal is present
- works best when signal masks noise
- works better on short transients than sustained or long-decay sounds
