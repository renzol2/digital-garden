# Chorus

A **chorus effect** (in audio) has the goal of transforming a single voice into a chorus of voices.

- requires subtle, unique variations in each voice
- [[digital-delay-line|delays]], detuning/slight vibrato, spectral variance

No definitive [[algorithm]]: many different implementations exist.

- most involve several [[variable-delay-effects|variable delays]] in parallel with or without [[feedback]]
- delay times modulated using oscillators or [[noise]] generators
