# Amplitude

**Amplitude** measures deviation of _pressure_ or displacement from rest/equilibrium

- a broad, generic term

Acoustic **power**, measured in Watts (W) measures the rate at which energy is converted (Joules per second)

- commonly indicated on signal amplifiers

Sound **intensity** measures power distributed over a unit area

- power measures sound strength irrespective of source/listener locations
- intensity varies depending on distance between source and listener

Sound intensity is proportional to sound pressured squared

$10^{12}$ â†’ the ratio of the greatest intensity we can tolerate to the smallest intensity we can perceive

- annoyingly large range of numbers to work with, resulting in the [[decibel]] unit

[[envelope|Envelopes]] are used to describe amplitude over time.
