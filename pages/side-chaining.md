# Side-Chaining

**Side-chaining** refers to a signal routing configuration in which a _source_ signal controls an effect, while the results are applied to a different, _target_ signal

- frequently used with DRP ([[dynamic-range-processing]]), can be used with other types of effects
- can be viewed as a type of [[modulation-synthesis]]

Side-chain [[compression]] is called **ducking**

- target signal "ducks" out of the way when the source signal is loud
- often in pop music: bass, chords, etc. will duck for the [[kick]]

Side-chain expansion/gating is called **amplitude following**

- target signal "follows" the [[amplitude]] contour of the source signal
- can be used to imprint one sound's [[envelope]] onto another (see: [[envelope-shaper]])
