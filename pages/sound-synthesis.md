# Sound Synthesis

**Sound synthesis** is the process of creating [[sound-waves|sound]], either by generating it from scratch or using existing sonic material.

Synthesis is often facilitated by using [[synthesizer|synthesizers]], either [[analog-synthesizers|analog]] or [[digital-synthesizers|digital]].

In sound synthesis, complex waves are generated by [[algorithm]]s of some type:

- [[additive-synthesis|Additive Synthesis]]
- [[subtractive-synthesis|Subtractive Synthesis]]
- [[modulation-synthesis|Modulation Synthesis]]
  - [[ring-modulation|Ring Modulation]]
  - [[frequency-modulation|Frequency Modulation]]
  - [[amplitude-modulation|Amplitude Modulation]]
- Karplus Strong
  - Loading up a buffer of [[noise]] and [[filter|filtering]] it
- [[granular-synthesis|Granular Synthesis]]
- Physical Modeling
- [[wavetable-synthesis|Wavetable synthesis]]

[[spectral-composition|Spectral composers]] adapt these synthesis techniques to compute 'symbolic [[spectrum|spectra]]' ([[pitch]] sets) rather than, or in addition to, [[audio-signal|audio signals]].

## Gesture to Sound

![Musician's gesture to sound](../public/attachments/gesture-to-sound.png)

A "musician's gesture" is any action that sends control data to some sound synthesis engine or [[algorithm]], from which an [[audio-signal|audio signal]] is produced.

- MIDI controllers send control data in the form of [[midi-message-format|MIDI messages]]
- at minimum, synthesizer can convert information into a [[frequency]] $f$ and [[amplitude]] $A$, which is usually enough information to generate sound
