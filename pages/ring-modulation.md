# Ring Modulation

In ring modulation, two signals of [[docs/frequency|frequencies]] $f_1$ and $f_2$ are multiplied, which results in *sum* and *difference* tones: $f_1+f_2$ and $|f_1-f_2|$.

There are two cases:

1. If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are both **sine waves**, then the output spectrum consists of two sidebands
2. Otherwise, the output spectrum consists of the sum and difference tones for each [[harmonic-series|harmonic]] in both signals

This results in the following:

- the output spectrum is unrelated to the inputs by harmonic relationship
- $f_1$ and $f_2$ do not appear in the resulting spectrum
- each partial in $f_1$ produces the sum and difference with all partials in $f_2$, which often results in dense sound
