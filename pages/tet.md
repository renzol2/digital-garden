# Twelve Equal Temperament Tuning

TET tuning is the standard Western tuning system (one of many [[tuning-systems]]).

From the vantage point of 12 TET, every [[pitch]] but the octave in the [[harmonic-series]] involves **microtones**, i.e. tones that lie somewhere between two adjacent equal tempered tones. From the vantage point of the harmonic series, the tones of the equal tempered scale are simply out of tune (not pure). (See: [[microtonal-music]])
