# Noise Floor

The **noise floor** refers to the quietest sounds (usually [[noise]]) in an [[audio-signal|audio signal]].

- oftentimes, the goal is to reduce the noise floor as much as possible through the use of [[expander|expanders]] or [[compander|companders]]
- [[compression]] and subsequent makeup gain results in raising the noise floor
