# renzo's foam

welcome to my foam! i want to publish my class notes here as a way to keep myself accountable for **learning** and really retaining the information, whether that be in class or in my own time.

this is also a way to put my own knowledge out in public for everyone to see and benefit from.

this is a huge WIP but feel free to look around!

as a starting point, try going to [[computer-music-and-digital-audio]]
