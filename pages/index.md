# renzo's foam

welcome to my foam! i want to publish my class notes here as a way to keep myself accountable for **learning** and really retaining the information, whether that be in class or in my own time.

this is also a way to put my own knowledge out in public for everyone to see and benefit from.

this is a huge WIP but feel free to look around!

_note_: since foam is still under development, the deployment of this repo is very broken lol proceed with caution. i'll work on a more stable solution in the future - if you want the best viewing experience, clone this repo into vscode with the necessary extensions

if you are on the deployment, try going to [[dynamic-range-processing]] as a starting point :)



[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[dynamic-range-processing]: dynamic-range-processing "Dynamic Range Processing"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
