# Audio Signal

An **audio signal** is an [[electrical-current|electrical current]] used to represent [[sound-waves|sound]].

- analog audio is represented by [[alternating-current|AC]]
- [[digital-audio|digital audio]] is represented by [[direct-current|DC]]

The levels (the power/intensity) of audio signals adhere to specific [[audio-level-standards|level standards]] across a signal chain.
