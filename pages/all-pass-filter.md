# All-Pass Filter

An **all-pass filter** is a [[sampling-signal-processing|signal processing]] [[filter]] that passes all [[frequency|frequencies]] equally in gain but changes the [[phase]] relationship among various frequencies.

## Within reverb

In [[reverb]] [[algorithm]]s, all-pass filters reduce [[resonance]] by introducing [[frequency]]-specific [[phase]]-shifts to diffuse the sound.
