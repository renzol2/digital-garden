# Electroacoustic Music

**Electroacoustic music** is music that depends on electronic technology for its creation/[[music-composition|composition]] and performance, referring to a practice that emerged during the early/mid-twentieth century and continues to develop today.

Difference between _electronic_ and _electroacoustic_ music is debatable

- terms are sometimes used interchangeably
- electroacoustic music tends to be used as a more all-encompassing term,
  - often implies a connection with academia and research.

## Early Instruments

Many early instruments formed the basis for electroacoustic music down the line.

These inventions and instruments were experiments and "accidents":

- [[musical-telegraph|Musical Telegraph]] (1847) - Elisha Gray
- [[singing-arc|Singing Arc]] (1899) - William Duddell, British physicist

These instruments were invented specifically for electronic music:

- [[Telharmonium]] (1897-1914)
- [[vacuum-tube| Vacuum Tube]]
- [[Theremin]] (1922)
- [[ondes-martenot|Ondes Martenot]] (1928)
- [[Trautonium]]
- [[hammond-organ|Hammond Organ]] (1935)
- [[rca-mark-ii-synthesizer|RCA Mark II Synthesizer]] (1957)
- [[harmonic-tone-generator|Harmonic Tone Generator]] (1964)
