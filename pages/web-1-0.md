# Web 1.0

A period of the internet from 1991-2004 where much of the content was "read-only", statically served from server filesystems and linked together solely through hyperlinks.

- Users were primarily **consumers**
- No authentication, log-in, analytics, etc.

Improvements came in the form of **Flash** and **JavaScript**.

Eventually, companies began allowing users to upload their own content to provide personalized web experiences for each person, leading to the start of [[web-2-0|Web 2.0]].
