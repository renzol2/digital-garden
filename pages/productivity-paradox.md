# Productivity paradox

The **productivity paradox** refers to a slowdown in productivity growth despite resources invested in computing and IT.

- Ex: IRS invested $50 mil in PCs for agents to enter data and perform calculations, but number of cases processed went down by 40% due to cumbersome [[user-interface|user interfaces]]
- See: _The Trouble with Computers_ (book)
