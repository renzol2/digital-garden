# Subtractive Synthesis

Subtractive synthesis is the process of generating [[sound-waves|sound]] by using [[filter|filters]] on broadband [[noise]] to create various [[spectrum|spectra]].

- filters attenuate spectral regions from a source sound
- filters are often highly selective and/or used in series
- noise generators as tone generators by routing noise through highly selective filters

Subtractive synthesis was used as an early technique in [[electroacoustic-music|electroacoustic music]].
