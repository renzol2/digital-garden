# Spectral Composition

Spectral composers take spectra (any noise), analyze the audio (FFTs), and use the resulting spectral information as compositional material.

- basically: music _about_ sound

## Harmonic/Inharmonic

For spectral and microtonal composers, the [[harmonic-series]] serves as an unlimited source of inspiration:

- instruments that exhibit the harmonic series in some way are good starting points
- any 1-D structure, like a string or column of air, exhibit the harmonic series in some way
- ex: stringed or woodwind instruments: pianos, clarinets, etc.

Instruments with inharmonic spectra are still useful and interesting.

- ex. drums, gongs, non-pitched percussive instruments

## Methods

In spectral composition, [[modulation-synthesis]] is often used as a tool.
