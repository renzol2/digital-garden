## History of Computer Music

See: [[MUSIC-N]]

### Early Computer Music at Illinois

1957, Illinois faculty **Lejaren Hiller** & **Leonard Isaacson**

- both chemists/[[music-composition|composers]]
- created the _Illiac Suite_, a four-movement string quartet
- first musical score to be generated by a computer using the ILLIAC I (Illinois Automatic Computer), built/acquired in 1952
- first computer at the U of I; 2.8k vacuum tubes, 10ft tall, 5 ton weight
- components currently on display in Siebel Center lobby

Two important academic centers founded ca. 1957-1958:

**University of Illinois Experimental Studios**:

- founded by Lejaren Hiller
- initially focused on computer [[music-composition|music composition]], later expanding into analog tape-based composition and other areas

**Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center**:

- founded by Otto Luening & Vladimir Ussachevsky (Columbia), Milton Babbit & Roger Sessions (Princeton)
- initially focused on analog tape-based composition, later expanding into computer music and other areas
- notable collaboration with Bell Labs

Two more computer music centers established in the 1970s:

**IRCAM**: Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique

- est. Paris, 1970, by Pierre Boulez

**CCRMA**: Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics

- est. Stanford University, CA, 1976, by John Chowning and Leland Smith

Both are still active hubs for electroacoustic/computer music today.

In the early decades of computer music, computer music was being created at institutional centers rather than in homes since mainframe computers were very expensive and required a high level of specialized knowledge.
