# Nagi disablement model

Nagi constructed a framework that differentiated among four phenomena
- active pathology - interruption of normal cellular processes
- impairment - abnormality at the tissue, organ, and body system level
- functional limitation - restrictions in the performance of the person
- disability - expression of a physical or a mental limitation in a social context

> "Disablity represents the gap between a person's intrinsic capabilities and the demands created by the social and physical environmnet - a product of the interaction of the individual with the environment"
