# Balanced audio

**Balanced audio** is an [[audio-signal|audio signal]] [[audio-signal-specifications|specification]] with the following characteristics:

- associated with [[professional-grade-audio]] gear
- uses _three_ wires for audio signal transmission (hot, cold, ground)
  - three-conductor cable
  - two-conductor shielded cable
- hot transmits signal, cold transmits inverted signal copy, ground/shield complete
- superior [[frequency]] response and [[dynamic-range]] compared to [[unbalanced-audio]] circuitry
- capable of rejecting interference
