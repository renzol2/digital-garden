# Compression on Drums

Below are some notes on using [[compression]] on drums.

For acoustic drums, see [[compressing-for-a-reason#Drums]]

- [[kick]] and snare should be balanced
- fast attack and slow release on kick to preserve [[envelope]]
- focus more on peaks rather than RMS
- adjust attack on snare to preserve "snap"

For drum samples (from [BlackGhostAudio](https://www.blackghostaudio.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-compression)):

- focus on [[buss-compression|buss compression]]
  - can lean towards compressors with "flavor and character"
  - Vertigo VSC-2
  - high attack to preserve [[transient|transients]] (~30ms?)
  - fast release (0.1-0.3s)
- most drum [[sampling-composition|samples]] are already compressed and don't need further compression
