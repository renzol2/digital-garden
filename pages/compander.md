# Compander

A **compander** combines the functionality of a compressor ([[compression]]) and [[expander]] into one processing unit

- portmanteau of "compressor" and "expander"

Companders are historically used in analog tape recording.

- input signal is compressed to allow recording at high levels while avoiding tape saturation
- output signal is expanded on reproduction to attenuate tape noise and return peaks to original level
