# Digital Audio

## Key Terms

**sampling**: the process of periodically measuring the [[amplitude]] of an analog signal and assigning a digital value to each measurement (see [[sampling-signal-processing]])

**sample rate**: number of samples taken per second

**quantization**: the process of approximating the measured analog value to the closest digital value

**[[bit-depth|bit depth]]**: the number of discrete digital values available for quantization (also called sample resolution or sample width)

**ADC**: analog-to-digital converter

**DAC**: digital-to-analog converter

**sampling theorem**: publication on the mathematical limitations of discretization of continuous signals

- Harry Nyquist, 1928
- also called [[nyquist-frequency|Nyquist Theorem]] or Shannon-Nyquist Theorem

**pulse code modulation (PCM)**: specification for computer digitization of continuous signals

- patented by Alec Reeves, 1938
- became one of the primary standardizations for digital representation of analog signals

## Sampling (disambiguation)

Sampling can have different meanings, depending on context.

- Using a significant portion of an existing work as a component in a new work
- Recording individual sound units from a musical instrument or other sound source, typically mapped to physical controls on a [[MIDI]] device and played back (see: [[sampling-composition|Sampling (composition)]])
- Taking periodic measurements of an analog signal (see: [[sampling-signal-processing|Sampling (signal processing)]])
