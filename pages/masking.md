# Masking

**Masking** is a phenomenon in which one [[sound-waves|sound]] conceals or obscures another

- e.g. electric guitar momentarily drowned out by crash cymbal
- conversation obscured by running water or background chatter
- increases minimum hearing threshold and reduces [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]]

Perpetual encoding [[algorithm]]s identify masked regions and assign fewer [[bit|bits]] to these [[sampling-signal-processing|samples]].
