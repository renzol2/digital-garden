# Models of disability

**Models of disability** describe different conceptual approaches to [[disability-studies|disability studies]].

- serve as standardized language for communication between:
  - healthcare professionals
  - policy makers
  - general public
- often facilitate the development of assessment tools for objective assessments and research
- promote patient-centered observation/analysis & evidence based practice (EBP)
