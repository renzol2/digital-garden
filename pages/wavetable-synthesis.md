# Wavetable Synthesis

**Wavetable synthesis** is a method of [[digital-audio|digital]] [[sound-synthesis|sound synthesis]] that pre-computes values of a [[waveform]] and stores them into a [[wave-table|wave table]].

- saves computation time and improves [[runtime]] by storing values of a waveform, rather than computing them for each [[sampling-signal-processing|sample]]

Below is a diagram of a wavetable synthesizer:

Diagram explanation:

- $k_{inc}[n]$ is the [[index-increment|index increment]], directly dependent on [[frequency]] (determined by some controller)
  - when no sound is played, $k_{inc}[n]$ is 0
- for each new output sample, index increment is added to some `index` variable stored in a single-sample buffer, $z^{-1}$
- index is kept into the range of wavetable indices $[0, L)$ using `fmod` (resulting in index/[[phase]] wrap)
- then, [[wave-table-lookup|lookup]] is performed using the computed index, using some interpolation strategy of choice
- finally, the signal is multiplied by some sample-dependent [[amplitude]] value $A[n]$, called the amplitude [[envelope]]
- output is represented by $y[n]$

## Sound design notes

- Using discontinuous wavetables (i.e. waveforms with big jumps, like sawtooth waveforms) will result in a rich [[spectrum]], i.e. full of [[harmonic|harmonics]]
  - However, this can result in [[aliasing]], especially at higher frequencies
