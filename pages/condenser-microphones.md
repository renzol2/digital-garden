# Condenser microphones

**Condenser microphones** are [[microphones]] that function via [[electrostatic-principles|electrostatic principles]].

- generally considered superior in audio quality compared to [[dynamic-microphones|dynamic mics]]
- capsule consists of 2 thin conductive plates, forming a capacitor (also called _capacitor mic_)
- design generally fragile, more expensive
- responds more easily, more readily
  - captures high [[frequency]] data better
- better [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] and [[frequency-response|frequency response]] than dynamic mics
- requires external [[direct-current|DC]] supply to function
  - usually phantom power: +48V supply from receiving device, or physical batter inside microphone
