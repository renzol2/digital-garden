# Nyquist Frequency

#music #mus-407 #signal-processing #sampling

The [[sampling-signal-processing|sampling]] theorem's primary consequence of digital audio:

- the highest [[pages/frequency]] that can be represented in a digital system is equal to half the [[sample-rate|sample rate]]
- this frequency is called the **Nyquist Frequency**:

$N = \frac{SR}{2}$

If a frequency $> N$ is sampled, the frequency of its digital representation will appear between 0 and $N$ Hz. This phenomenon is called [[aliasing]] or **foldover**.
