# OCaml

OCaml is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm [[programming-language|programming language]] that extends Caml with object-oriented features.

- has much basis in programming language research
- has many features not clearly in most conventional languages
- particularly efficient for programming tasks involving languages (e.g. parsing, compilers, [[user-interface|user interfaces]])

OCaml is industrially relevant, particularly in finance:

- Jane Street trades billions of dollars per day using OCaml
- Major language supported at Bloomberg

Similar languages:

- Microsoft F#
- SML
- Haskell
- [[scala|Scala]]
