# Polar pattern

A **polar pattern** describes [[microphones|mic]] sensitivity as a polar function of source angle relative to the mic's axis.

- also called _directional pattern, sensitivity pattern, pickup pattern, field pattern_

The types of polar patterns for microphones include:

- [[cardioid]]
- [[hypercardioid]]
- [[bidirectional]]
- [[omnidirectional]]
