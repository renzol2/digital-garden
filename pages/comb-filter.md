# Comb Filter

**Comb filters** are [[audio-signal|audio signal]] [[filter|filters]] that filter out [[noise]] into discrete [[frequency|frequencies]] and impose [[resonance]].

## Implementation

Comb filters are just **[[digital-delay-line|delay lines]] with [[feedback]]**

- feeding signal into itself with an extremely _short delay time_, to the point of hearing a periodic waveform
- any [[partial]] with aligns with the inverse of the delay time (and all the [[harmonic]]s of that partial) will experience 100% [[wave-interference|constructive interference]]
  - creates peaks in the [[spectrum]]
- conversely, any harmonic that has 1.5/2.5/3.5/etc. times the [[frequency]] of the original partial will experience 100% [[wave-interference|destructive interference]]
