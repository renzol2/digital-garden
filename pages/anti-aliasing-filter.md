# Anti-aliasing filter

An **anti-aliasing filter** is a [[filter]] used before a signal [[sampling-signal-processing|sampler]] to restrict the bandwidth of a [[audio-signal|signal]] to satisfy the [[nyquist-frequency|Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]] over the band of interest (Wikipedia).

- literally, a filter that prevents [[aliasing]]
